## Project Overview

## Coding Standards

### License and Copyright Headers

- This project is distributed under the MIT license.
- Every source file should start with a header comment specifying the license
  using an SPDX license identifier along with a copyright notice.
  - That header should be separated from the remainder of the file with a blank
    line, if the file format permits.
  - Markdown files need not contain such a header.

### Copyright Holder Guidelines

- The holder on the copyright line is the name of individual contributors
  and/or their company.
- When adding significant new contributions to a file:
  - If there's already a copyright for your holder, it's not required to add
    the current year (but allowed). Never replace existing years.
  - If there's no line for your copyright holder, add one with the current
    year.

## Documentation Standards

- Use clear, concise markdown formatting.
- Maintain consistent structure across documentation files.
- Always reference Tarides branding at the bottom of documentation files.
  - This only applies if the Tarides branding is not already present elsewhere
    in the file.
- Follow markdown best practices.

## General Guidelines

- When making changes, ensure they maintain documentation clarity and accuracy.
- Document any new policies or practices in the appropriate files.
- Keep language professional and accessible.
