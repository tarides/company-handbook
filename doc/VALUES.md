# Values

Our group values are:

🤝 **Collaboration**

We work as a team within a larger ecosystem of individual contributors,
companies and research labs. We build trust and strive towards common goals
using constructive consensus. We understand that project outcomes result from
iterative steps, collaboratively blending our teams’ diverse skills and
expertise.

🚤 **Ownership**

We encourage our team members to be autonomous and take ownership of their work
while collaborating as needed. We identify gaps in our processes or technology
stacks. We design, discuss and coordinate on specific projects and bring the
essential skills and expertise required to build solutions we are proud to own.
We are accountable and deliver the work that we promised.

🐫 **Community**

We create a friendly and safe environment where people can evolve and grow by
making mistakes and learning from each other while happily working towards
their individual goals. We are part of an organisation composed of diverse
individuals working together on shared objectives and visions. We value
humility and recognise that we can all learn from each other’s expertise and
experiences.

🧐 **Curiosity**

We use our robust understanding of both theory and practice to solve our
problems. We use and apply the scientific method to all our activities. We
explore ideas at the intersection of research and engineering, as we believe
that we learn best by doing. We seek to transfer acute research ideas into
concrete engineering projects with a measurable impact or devise new theories
from very applied experiences.

💥 **Impact**

We build systems based on a scientific foundation to last for decades and drive
positive change for the world. We do not compromise on quality. We both use and
build open-source software to craft original, unique systems that have a
significant, positive impact on our community, industry, and society.
