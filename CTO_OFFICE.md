# CTO Office

The CTO Office is a department of Tarides. It exists to strengthen our
collaboration with universities and research laboratories and reinforce our
leadership position within the OCaml ecosystem. The department aims to improve
Tarides' impact in advancing OCaml research and teaching, and drive the
language’s development over the next decade.

Members of the CTO Office report directly to the CTO. This provides those
selected individuals already active both within Tarides and within a University
(initially Cambridge and IIT Madras) with greater autonomy to pursue high-risk,
high-impact projects.

Members of the CTO Office must maintain strong community and Tarides ties
through structured mentorship, regular community engagement, and regular public
reporting.

## Goals

Enhanced Autonomy: Members of the CTO office must operate independently,
focusing on contributions they consider the most impactful to the OCaml
ecosystem.

Foster Mentorship: Each member of the CTO office must leverage their network
(including connections with top-tier universities or organisations like
Outreachy) to supervise good students in the community, cultivating the next
generation of OCaml contributors. They must actively mentor junior Tarides
staff and might engage more senior Tarides engineers in supervision. This can
be slightly different from programs such as Outreachy, where mentoring is
typically remote and the primary goal. Remote mentoring when the projects
themselves being worked on are more critical, or the engineers are only remote
to the mentor (e.g. in Paris), can be more difficult, but in this case,
mentoring may also be supporting and fostering Tarides’ local mentors to
strengthen and expand the Tarides internship program.

Drive Research & Events: Members of the CTO office are expected to organise
regular external hacking events, organise and co-chair conferences, and publish
research papers showcasing OCaml innovations. They will also serve as strategic
advisors on Tarides’ community-driven product initiatives and attend community
committees (and/or actively influence the decision-making process of the
Community unit) to ensure alignment with Tarides' goals.

Ensure Accountability: Members of the CTO office must submit a quarterly report
detailing their activities. Once validated by Tarides, these reports will be
incorporated into Tarides’ (public or private) reports to highlight their
contributions to the broader community and its relationship with Tarides'
activities. If urgent assistance is needed for a particular project, such as
meeting a release deadline, members of the CTO office may be asked to
contribute on a best-effort basis.

The members of the CTO office will focus on research directly impacting the
OCaml community (i.e. OxCaml), mentoring to form the next generation of OCaml
maintainers, and maintenance of core infrastructure projects. They will use
their link with the University of Cambridge to be extremely visible in terms of
publications, public communication, code production, and access to excellent
students.

## Governance

The department's impact on Tarides and the OCaml community will be
reviewed every 6 months by Tarides’ leadership team. The members will also be
reviewed every 6 months (with ample notice if a termination occurs).

## Reporting Structure

Members of the CTO office report to the CTO. The goal of the CTO office is to
work with Universities (initially Cambridge and IIT-Madras, and later others)
to advance OCaml research and teaching and drive OCaml development. Members
will be evaluated with respect to the points above: community impact, mentorship
impact, research, events and public reporting.
